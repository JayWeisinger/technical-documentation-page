                        At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.

                        Before starting this module, you don't need any previous HTML knowledge, but you should have at least basic familiarity with using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it and consuming content). You should have a basic work environment set up (as detailed in Installing basic software), and understand how to create and manage files (as detailed in Dealing with files). Both are parts of our Getting started with the web complete beginner's module.

                        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.  For example, consider the following line of text:
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="code-block">
                    <code>
                        My cat is very grumpy
                    </code>

                    <p>
                        If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph  (&lt;p&gt;) element:
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="code-block">

This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                            <b>The closing tag: </b>This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.

                        Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word very in a &lt;strong&gt; element, which means that the word is to have strong(er) text formatting:
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="code-block">
                    <code>
                        &lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;<b>very</b>&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;

                    <p>
                        There is a right and wrong way to do nesting. In the example above, we opened the p element first, then opened the strong element. For proper nesting, we should close the strong element first, before closing the p.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="article-paragraph">

                        The following is an example of the wrong way to do nesting:

                    <p>
                        The tags have to open and close in a way that they are inside or outside one another. With the kind of overlap in the example above, the browser has to guess at your intent. This kind of guessing can result in unexpected results.

                        Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements consist of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document. For example, the &lt;img&gt; element embeds an image file onto a page:
                    </p>
                </div>

                            More recently, the doctype is a historical artifact that needs to be included for everything else to work right. <div id="highlighted">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</div> is the shortest string of characters that counts as a valid doctype. That is all you need to know!

                            <div id="highlighted">&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</div>: The <div id="highlighted">&lt;html&gt;</div> element. This element wraps all the content on the page. It is sometimes known as the root element.

                            <div id="highlighted">&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</div>: The <div id="highlighted">&lt;head&gt;</div> element. This element acts as a container for everything you want to include on the HTML page, <b>that isn't the content</b> the page will show to viewers. This includes keywords and a page description that would appear in search results, CSS to style content, character set declarations, and more. You'll learn more about this in the next article of the series.

                            <div id="highlighted">&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</div>: This element specifies the character set for your document to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages. With this setting, the page can now handle any textual content it might contain. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <div id="highlighted">&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</div>: The <div id="highlighted">&lt;title&gt;</div> element. This sets the title of the page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. The page title is also used to describe the page when it is bookmarked.
                        </li>

                            <div id="highlighted">&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</div>: The <div id="highlighted">&lt;body&gt;</div> element. This contains all the content that displays on the page, including text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.

                        HTML has a mechanism to write comments in the code. Browsers ignore comments, effectively making comments invisible to the user. The purpose of comments is to allow you to include notes in the code to explain your logic or coding. This is very useful if you return to a code base after being away for long enough that you don't completely remember it. Likewise, comments are invaluable as different people are making changes and updates.

                <div class="article-paragraph">
                    <p>
                        To write an HTML comment, wrap it in the special markers&nbsp;<div id="highlighted">&lt;!-- and --&gt;</div>. For example:
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="code-block">

                        The HTML head is the contents of the&nbsp;<div id="highlighted">&lt;head&gt;</div> element — unlike the contents of the <div id="highlighted">&lt;body&gt;</div> element (which are displayed on the page when loaded in a browser), the head's content is not displayed on the page. Instead, the head's job is to contain metadata about the document. In the above example, the head is quite small:
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="code-block">

                        &lt;head&gt;<br>&ensp;&ensp;
                            &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;<br>&ensp;&ensp;
                            &lt;title&gt;My test page&lt;/title&gt;<br>
                        &lt;/head&gt;

                        In larger pages however, the head can get quite full. Try going to some of your favorite websites and use the developer tools to check out their head contents. Our aim here is not to show you how to use everything that can possibly be put in the head, but rather to teach you how to use the major elements that you'll want to include in the head, and give you some familiarity.

                        Webpages can and will look pretty different from one another, but they all tend to share similar standard components, unless the page is displaying a fullscreen video or game, is part of some kind of art project, or is just badly structured:
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div id="list">
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Header:</b>
                            Usually a big strip across the top with a big heading, logo, and perhaps a tagline. This usually stays the same from one webpage to another.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Navigation bar:</b>
                            Links to the site's main sections; usually represented by menu buttons, links, or tabs. Like the header, this content usually remains consistent from one webpage to another — having inconsistent navigation on your website will just lead to confused, frustrated users. Many web designers consider the navigation bar to be part of the header rather than an individual component, but that's not a requirement; in fact, some also argue that having the two separate is better for accessibility, as screen readers can read the two features better if they are separate.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Main content:</b>
                            A big area in the center that contains most of the unique content of a given webpage, for example, the video you want to watch, or the main story you're reading, or the map you want to view, or the news headlines, etc. This is the one part of the website that definitely will vary from page to page!
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Sidebar:</b>
                            Some peripheral info, links, quotes, ads, etc. Usually, this is contextual to what is contained in the main content (for example on a news article page, the sidebar might contain the author's bio, or links to related articles) but there are also cases where you'll find some recurring elements like a secondary navigation system.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Footer:</b>
                            A strip across the bottom of the page that generally contains fine print, copyright notices, or contact info. It's a place to put common information (like the header) but usually, that information is not critical or secondary to the website itself. The footer is also sometimes used for SEO purposes, by providing links for quick access to popular content.
                        </li>

                        It's good to understand the overall meaning of all the HTML sectioning elements in detail — this is something you'll work on gradually as you start to get more experience with web development. You can find a lot of detail by reading our HTML element reference. For now, these are the main definitions that you should try to understand:
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div id="list">
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <div id="highlighted">&lt;main&gt;</div> is for content unique to this page. Use <div id="highlighted">&lt;main&gt;</div> only once per page, and put it directly inside <div id="highlighted">&lt;body&gt;</div>. Ideally this shouldn't be nested within other elements.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <div id="highlighted">&lt;article&gt;</div> encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page (e.g., a single blog post).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <div id="highlighted">&lt;section&gt;</div> is similar to <div id="highlighted">&lt;article&gt;</div>, but it is more for grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes one single piece of functionality (e.g., a mini map, or a set of article headlines and summaries), or a theme. It's considered best practice to begin each section with a heading; also note that you can break <div id="highlighted">&lt;article&gt;</div>s up into different <div id="highlighted">&lt;section&gt;</div>s, or <div id="highlighted">&lt;section&gt;</div>s up into different <div id="highlighted">&lt;article&gt;</div>s, depending on the context.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <div id="highlighted">&lt;aside&gt;</div> contains content that is not directly related to the main content but can provide additional information indirectly related to it (glossary entries, author biography, related links, etc.).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <div id="highlighted">&lt;header&gt;</div> represents a group of introductory content. If it is a child of <div id="highlighted">&lt;body&gt;</div> it defines the global header of a webpage, but if it's a child of an <div id="highlighted">&lt;article&gt;</div> or <div id="highlighted">&lt;section&gt;</div> it defines a specific header for that section (try not to confuse this with titles and headings).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <div id="highlighted">&lt;nav&gt;</div> contains the main navigation functionality for the page. Secondary links, etc., would not go in the navigation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <div id="highlighted">&lt;footer&gt;</div> represents a group of end content for a page.
